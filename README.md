# tabs-to-html #

AppleScripts to save out links to all open tabs as an HTML file

### Notes ###

This is a first pass for my own use. I don't have instructions on how to use it (or binaries), and the HTML is ugly. Still, hopefully it's useful.

### TODO ###

* ~~Remove path hardcoding~~
* Write install instructions
* Create binary bundle that you can drop into place
* Support OneTab export/import format
* Styling

### Suggestions ###

Things I can't imagine bothering to do but which I'd love to pull in:

* Add Firefox support
